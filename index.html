        <pre>Create a square-format human anatomy educational diagram that prioritizes anatomical accuracy, information density, and efficient use of space.

The image must be a multi-panel medical diagram filling at least 85 percent of the square canvas, with minimal empty margins and no decorative borders.

At the top center, include the title "HUMAN ANATOMY" in clear, high-contrast lettering that is readable at small sizes.

At the center of the image, place a front-facing adult male human figure with skin removed to show the muscular system.

The figure should stand upright with arms relaxed at the sides and feet together.

Muscles must be anatomically correct, clearly separated, and accurately proportioned.

The central figure should be the largest and most visually dominant element.

Surrounding the central figure, arrange compact, clearly separated panels showing the following systems, all fully visible and not cropped:

• Brain, shown separately with major regions identifiable
• Skeletal system, full front-facing skeleton
• Heart, standalone with major vessels
• Digestive system, from esophagus to intestines
• Eye, cross-sectional view with internal structures
• Cardiovascular system, heart with arteries and veins
• Urinary system, kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra
• Secondary muscular detail panel highlighting named muscle groups

Each panel must include legible labels with thin leader lines pointing precisely to anatomical structures.

Labels must use correct anatomical terminology with no misspellings and no invented anatomy.

The visual style should be clear medical textbook illustration, flat lighting, neutral background, and high clarity.

Do not emphasize paper texture, aging, folds, stains, decorative borders, or faux historical elements.

The background must remain visually quiet and must not compete with the anatomy.

The goal is a reference-quality anatomy chart, optimized for clarity, accuracy, and efficient use of square space.</pre>

    <h2>Why Ghost and AIMAGE Sat This One Out</h2>

    <div class="section-copy">
      <p class="subhead">Ghost Human Baseline: No poster, on purpose.</p>

      <p>
        This warm-up prompt is the kind of assignment AI loves, and human studios should refuse unless a
        client is paying for it. Ghost is a production shop with deadlines, reviews, and client priorities.
        Spending real artist hours to create a polished, information-dense anatomy poster purely for a benchmark
        would be an expensive distraction from billable work. That's the core advantage AI keeps pressing on:
        <strong>speed.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        AI can generate a dozen poster variations in minutes, while a human team would need hours or days to do it
        properly, and then still go through the usual accuracy review cycle. That's exactly how AI starts winning
        the early rounds. It gets you something usable fast, even if it's not perfect. Once these tools reliably
        pass a "medical accuracy Turing test," where the output is indistinguishable from expert work to the
        non-expert viewer, most human artists won't be replaced outright. They'll be pushed upstream into higher
        leverage roles like creative direction, prompt and pipeline design, and downstream into quality control,
        fact-checking, and correction passes. In other words: fewer people making images from scratch, more people
        supervising, correcting, and approving.
      </p>

      <p class="subhead">AIMAGE: No poster because it's not trained for this format.</p>

      <p>
        AIMAGE is not a general-purpose, do-anything image generator. It depends on Ghost's reference library and
        training data. If Ghost hasn't fed it thousands of examples of dense, labeled, textbook-style anatomy posters,
        then this specific assignment is outside its learned distribution. It might produce something poster-like,
        but it would be guesswork and style imitation rather than a confident reproduction of a familiar format.
      </p>

      <p>
        That limitation is important, and it's also fair. Domain-tuned models like AIMAGE are usually excellent inside
        their lane and unremarkable outside it. So for this test, AIMAGE sat out because the goal was to stress-test
        general instruction following, layout discipline, and label behavior on a poster format that wasn't part of its
        training foundation.
      </p>

      <p>
        So the warm-up results are "AI vs AI" by design. Not because Ghost couldn't make the poster, but because making
        it would miss the point. The whole reason this comparison matters is that AI can afford to do experiments humans
        can't justify doing.
